# PD-WitMotion-Headtracker
Puredata patches to use the WitMotion Bluetooth 9-DOF Sensor

These patches help to convert the data retreived from a WitMotion W-901BCL Bluetooth Sensor into more human readable format.

My personal use-case is to use them as a headtracker and control the rotation of Ambisonics scenes like the Scene Rotator plugin from the IEM Plugin Suite [plugins.iem.at]

The patches are made for my personal use but may be are useful for others. They have to be considered "unmaintained" as i will develop them further mainly to my own needs.
Input is welcome nonetheless.

Dependencies:
The patches are made in Puredata 0.53 and need the following libraries to be installed:
- Comport
- Zexy
